# This is your formative feedback for the IBI1 portfolio.


## Please do the following:

- [ ] Add this file to your GitHub fork of IBI1_2018-19. You are allowed to delete the last line (giving your score) before uploading the file to GitHub, if you do not want others to see it. 
- [ ] Make changes to your code from weeks 3 to 5 according to the feedback below. This will form part of your summative assessment. (You may use the checkboxes to keep track of your progress) 


## Feedback:

### Feedback Week 3:

The code for week 3 is great. There is no need to change anything.

### Feedback Week 4:

- [ ] The powers of 2 file is almost perfect (I looked only at the section entitled "my code"), but would be even better if the printed answer contained what the number was. (So, for instance "1750 = ..." instead of "x = ...")

### Feedback Week 5:

- [ ] In the file computing nucleotide content of DNA, inputting a sequence gives two different results. Then the software asks me to input another sequence, and then it gives me another result that matches the first. I can see the value of looking at different methods, but for the user, it is better to just have one method in one file (nothing stops you from having another script called "Counting DNA Nucleotides Method2.py" or something. It is especially a problem if different methods give different results, as is the case here.

- [ ] The string reverse and list sorting code is almost correct, but in the example given to you, you were asked to reverse-sort the list of reversed words, i.e. going from last to first in the alphabet.


This asssesment is formative and does not form part of your final grade. 

If this was a summative assessment, you would have scored 92 out of 100
