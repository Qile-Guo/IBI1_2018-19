#week3:
There is no change.

#week4
Power of 2:I create a new variable to contain the orgnial input of x. It is used in printing the answer which contains what the number is instead of simple "x". Thus, the answer is clearer. Additionally,to make output clearer, I delete methods(codes) from others and store them in another file(not uploaded).

#week5
Computing nucleotide content of DNA: To avoid the situation where inputing sequence gives two different results(Actually this is because method2 has its own sequence and does not use input) and make the output clearer, I delete methods(codes) from others and store them in another file (not uploaded).I also change some parameters of pie plot(colors,explode,startangle) to make pie plot more beautiful and easier to read.Additonally, I add the tittle of pie plot to indicate content in pie plot.

String reverse and list sorting: To reverse-sort the list of reversed words, I convert the string into string first and use the for loop to reserve every word in list instead of reserving the whole string and then converting it.I also add explanation for not using "for i in l:
 i = i[::-1]" in the for loop.
