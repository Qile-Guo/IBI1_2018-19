mouse and human sequence are compared
BLOSUM62 raw score: 1091 
BLOSUM62 normalized score: 4.914
Identity: 89.64%

mouse and random sequence are compared
BLOSUM62 raw score: -250 
BLOSUM62 normalized score: -1.126
Identity: 5.86%

human and random sequence are compared
BLOSUM62 raw score: -250
BLOSUM62 normalized score: -1.126
Identity: 5.41%

The BLOSUM62 scores are high for those who are similar.

With 89.64% identity, human and mouse genes coding SOD2 protein are quite similar.
There are lots of differences between mouse and random sequence or human and random sequence.

BLOSUM62 raw score is normalized to the sequence length. The normalized score is relative score among alignments which can be used to compare sequences of different length.

More parameters are required to compare two sequences more accurately.
